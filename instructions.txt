** The Swim or Stay clock - (SAS Edition of The Yes/No Clock) **

This is the swim/surf clock, wake up, check the time, check the beach water quality.

The clock connects to your WiFi, checks the internet and will update the water quality status every hour.


* Batteries:
The clock needs 4 AA batteries to run.

* Setup:
The clock needs your wifi name and password so it can get the latest water quality.

If you plug in the USB cable, you'll see a file called "settings.toml", it should look like this:

```
CLOCK_WIFI_SSID = "my_WiFi_name"
CLOCK_WIFI_PASSWORD = "my_secret_password"
CLOCK_BEACH_NAME = "Gyllingvase"
```

Each setting can be updated to connect to your WiFi and get your local water conditions.

Beach Names:
The beach name can be any point listed on the map here: https://www.sas.org.uk/water-quality/sewage-pollution-alerts/
(Note that it is case sensitive and has to match exactly)
